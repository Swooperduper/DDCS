# firstdata-ts-testapp
a fully filled out backend for typescript on nodeJS express and uses overnightJS to handle routing to the controllers<br>
(it adds TypeScript decorators to express), it also handles logging when needed

## Commands:
(Some of these commands require `npm install` to have been run beforehand)
- `npm start`: start the app in production mode. Production code must be built for production first (needs linux env): `npm run build`.
- `npm run start-dev`: start the server in dev mode. Will activate automated file-watcher and generate source-maps.
- `npm run build` at _root/_ will build the app for production. Contents are put into _build/_.
- `npm test`: Run back-end unit-tests
